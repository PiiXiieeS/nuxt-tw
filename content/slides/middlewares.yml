description: "The <code>middleware</code> directory contains your application middleware. Middleware lets you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages (layout).
              <br/><br/>
              Shared middleware should be placed in the <code>middleware/</code> directory. The filename will be the name of the middleware (<code>middleware/auth.js</code> will be the <code>auth</code> middleware)."
